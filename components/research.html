                    <p><b>Category: </b>Work Experience</p>

                    <p><b>About: </b>I worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Calgary alongside Dr. C. Mannion for about 3 years. 
                        I worked on a project that dealt with the phenomenon of pica, the ingestion of non-food items such as clay or ice,
                         among pregnant or breastfeeding women. </p>

                    <p>
                        I was involved throughout the entire span of the project from recruiting participants, to interviewing them, to transcribing 
                        data, to analysing data, and to writing up draft papers for publication. Pica is a stigmatized topic, which made recruitment 
                        challenging. We ended up recruiting about 13 participants as we expanded the search online over social media sites. Publication 
                        is pending, as I finished writing up the draft, but awaiting approval for publication from my supervisor.
